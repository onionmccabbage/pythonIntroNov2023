=======
Design a python application using good archtecture (modules inside packages)
In one module, ask the user to enter a non-empty string of text
In another module, validate that this string is indeed non-empty
In another module, commit this text string to a txt file 
A main module will bring all these parts together
If the user enters 'quit' then stop writing to the file
Otherwise, keep asking the uisef for entries and write to file
If the user enters 'read' then stop writing and read it all back again
(use another module)

Optional
--------
import datetime and always add a date stamp to the written file
write bytes instead of text
