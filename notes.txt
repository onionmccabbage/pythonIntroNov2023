Monday
> Welcome
- where to write code: immediate, module (just a file) etc.
  Pycharm or VSCode or ...
q - code  completion and introspection - how to see what is available
> can we use shortcut keys to indent (format) like shift-F4
q - can we use float in a range???
- overview of Python 3 (and Python 2)
- architecture, structure, and professional code best practice
> print() and input()
> maths operators and data types
> the if statement for conditional logic
> while loop, break and pass
> indentation
> immutable strings
> print formatting f'' or ''.format()
> square bracket notation for slicing iterable collections
- memory efficiency
> identifiers
> boolean True and False
- type and type conversion
> validate input before casting it
- string manipulation
- Lists, Tuples and nested collections
> after lunch review exercise
- dictionaries (non-numeric indexed iterable collections)
- import, pip, libraries and modules
- very big numeric values
> += etc.
- pep8 coding style suggestions for Python
> looping with 'for'
> importing other modules
> if __name__ ...

Tuesday
> the recordings... (username: neueda password: c0nygre)
- quick review of where we got to
> Python 2 migrate to Python 3
  https://docs.python.org/3/howto/pyporting.html
> Why use functions (rather than shorter code)
- can we import modules having same name but from different packages
- block scope and global scope
- follow good practice for architecture and performance
- range, generators
- set comprehension, list compresension, dictionary comprehension
- other implementations of Python: cpython is the default - also jython ipython ironpython
> functions, *args, **kwargs  
- also, passing command-line arguments (which are ALWAYS strings)
- to add libraries to python:
  - python -m ensurepip
  - python â€“m pip install requests (or any other library you need)
- requests
- strings with triple quotes
- exception handling (try-except etc.)
- review exercise
- import path
- overview of testing
- File input and output

Wednesday
- brief review so far
- functions live in classes, which live in modules which live in packages
- architecture: modules __init__.py and __name__ == '__main__'
- PEP8 style guide
- custom generator and yield
- global and local scope 
- read and write binary files (bytes) - use 'b' isntead of 't'
- data modelling structures: 
    use built in structures until they do not suit the purpose (then use classes)
- Objects and Classes (OOP)
- get/set as property decorators @property
- name mangling (__)
    we should use getter/setter to prevent direct access, 
    but we can add arbitrary properies and methods to a class
- properties, methods, __str__
- documentation strings (docstring) for classes
- special operators and overriding
- inheritance
- composition, static and class methods
- review exercise
- how to format with certain dp
- debug tools
- where to go from here:
